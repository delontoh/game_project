Game Project- Catch 'Em All

**About this game**
This is a traditional snake game with a slight twist to it.

The player has to navigate around the terrain with keyboard arrow keys and retrieve pokeballs along the way.


*Objective*
The player will attempt to acheive a highscore by obtaining as many "Pokeballs" as possible. 


*Challenges*
The player has to avoid colliding with itself and the game boundaries on all sides.

Obstacles(Snorlaxes) will also randomly appear along the way and the player has to avoid those as well.


**Instructions**
Use the directional arrow keys: "Up", "Down", "Left" and "Right" for navigation.

Collect as many Pokeballs as possible.

Game ends when these occurs:
	-Player collides with it's own body.
	-Player collides with terrain boundaries.
	-Player collides with an obstacle.

**How I built this game**
I created this with Vanilla Javascript and did some DOM manipulation. CSS canvas was used for styling.


**Limitations**
Pokeballs will sometimes overlay with obstacles and vice versa. Player will not be able to continue game if this occurs.
